               From the shadows of Alexandria to the Salem woods, the forces of witchcraft are at work tainting the innocent and unwary. Your contact's cousin has been acting under the influence of demonic impulse, used in the service of seduction, conception, and childbirth in a manner that comes to light only as you confront the village Witches and their infernal practice.

               At the head of the coven are three hags, abiding in Salem for centuries carrying out most horrible rituals necessary to meet the infanticide demands of their demonic pacts. Using magic to enslave young girls, seduce their neighbors, and then through dark powers carry the babies to term in mere days, these little unnatural souls are born only to be massacred in the woods in the name of Chaldaean divinities.

               With the Hammer of the Witches as your guide, you begin pierce the veil of the coven, unmasking its lessor oblivious members through penetrating questions. Under the duress of curse and hex, and must endure sabotage and insidious social intrigues as you track down the hags to their hidden dens.

               With time dwindling and your welcome overstayed, investigations must be accelerated. You've somehow managed to arrange for the girl's release into your custody, during which period there are none in the village whose eyes are not fixed upon your every move. Even so, with the cousin at hand you can at last seek more direct answers.

               After a time, you feel almost as if the girl has two personalities, one in whose innocence and fear are plain to see, and another whose difference lies in an imperceptible shift of manner toward a diabolical and insinuating humor. During these darker moments, you find yourselves surrounded by ominous coincidence, such as the presence of black cats, sulfurous odors, and the unseasonable baying of valley wolves. 

               It is only listening to the trembling words of the aged and wizened senior townsfolk as they recount a dark history of the village that you gain an understanding of the forces at play. Absent names, you learn of a coven which has for centuries practiced mass infanticide upon altars in the woods. The Witches use hexes and geas to hide themselves and control their victims, but as an old man says from the shadows of his parlor as he hands you something from a trunk, "this book destroyeth Witches and their heresy like a most powerful spear".

               Finding an advertisement in Popular Science Monthly promising a generous wage for qualified lab assistants, you can proudly sign on for a vague contract performing unspecified scientific scut work. A modicum of mechanical understanding and an eagerness for heavy lifting should be enough to pass the screening.

               Behind the endless doors of the research lab, the NELA's finest inventors are hard at work exploiting the medium of light, but to what other doors of the universe might their work lead?

               Those that remain inside feel compelled to find their way to the master hall where candelabras have been lit and an opulent stage unveiled. The towering estate windows reveal a limitless starry space to have replaced the view of the exterior grounds. 

               As inhumanoid costumed creatures take the stage in allegorical pantomime and dreadful music begins to rise, the monstrous play The King In Yellow is about to be performed, with the playwright himself assuming the role of the decadent king of Yhtill.

               Attired in a gaudy tatterdemalion outfit of grotesque design, the guests are informed they shall play a game of hide and seek before the commencement of the play, limited to the hoary estate house, 105 bedrooms large and riddled with curious passageways. 

               The drunken game unlocks a mood of lechery and excess in the darkened estate, and giggling and foppish moans and screams fill the halls. As you creep through the passages trying to avoid the playwright and his harlequin servants, it becomes clear that the game is not so innocent after all, and that, in fact, they play has already begun.

               An invitation with a twisted yellow seal arrived addressed to you personally; after much thought you can imagine no reason why you were made a guest, but the allure of the event holds some hint of the macabre and sinister.

               Like the other guests, many of whom have been outed in the daily gossip columns, you are under strict instructions to arrive in full costume, and to expect festivities until the latest hours of the night. Everyone from bohemians to eccentric American royalty is rumored to attend.

               Before your grandfather was a man of the world, he spent his college years in prolific engagement in one of the top academic clubs at university. After recently passing from this world, your idle perusal of his safekeepings uncovered a journal where grandfather soberly describes a tragedy occasioned by the foolish occult explorations of a small group of he and his club companions many years ago.

               Having only the weakest sense of their actions, the young men used a grimoire acquired by the club president to horrible effect, ultimately summoning to an abandoned farmhouse an otherworldly evil that nearly killed them that night but for the judiciously prepared wards the students had the good sense to heed.

               The wards, however, were to last only so long as the summoners lived. With your grandfather's passing, the last of the old friends has died, and the evil in the farmhouse will soon waken to discover that it can escape into the corporeal realm of man. It's not too late, but you'll have to act wisely to defeat the terrible being.

So how did a cadaveor manage to live long enough to unmistakably attack a living witness?

               The dead man attended the Miskatonic School of Medicine, a likely beginning for so unusual a case of physiological contradictions. Would not the students who kept the man's company be able to say more? 

               There is one confidant in particular who suggests interest: Corey Owen is the name of a young physician's student, known to have been connected to both the deceased and the victim through their university studies.

               Horrors have gripped you that you cannot shake, that have lodged themselves in the corners of your mind where they emenate and presage dire comings, in hints manifest all about the waking world.

               Your mind can no longer endure the nightly torments and daily exhaustion; it's time to reach through the fog of these dreams and banish their chilling, prognostic haze. Whatever meaning has crept into your unconscious mind must be uncovered, understood, expelled.

               Few translations have been attempted, but of those the most probable is agreed to have been scribed by the Reverend Arthur Brooke Winters-Hall, a learned Sussex Clergyman with not inconsiderable powers of conjecture and imagination. 

               From the ex libris of the English countryside it's possible that the Revered's folios have found their way by blind chance into the bookstalls of nescient peddlers. How might one play chance to stumble upon such a find, should it even exist?

               Yet the publisher of an archeological trade journal has let slip that he received a draft manuscript containing the translations and marginalia of G'harne scholars, but would regrettably be destroying the item at the end of his research to honor the ominous request of the mystery translator. 
               
               Until that time it can be surmised that the reckless publisher is keeping his copy hidden under lock and key.

The thunder of events from the Great War to the strife of nations and despots, the march of science, airplanes and earthquakes, history is forever trembling in the shadows which darkened the mind of a seer.

               With a proper reading of the quatrains, taken through a wider lens into the more ancient prognostications of sages such as Telesphorus, Joachim of Fiore, and Merlin, you can just make out the stage of history at present moment. It takes equal measures of genius and liquor to fix the events foreseen by Nostradamus in the present day.

               If you can believe anything after the lines of French doomsaying echo from your mind, it's that the worst of the prophecies, the most apocalyptical, are yet to come.

They would have you see to the welfare of a young cousin who has been accused of witchcraft and stands ready, say the local rumors, for the farmer's fire, learned and remembered from those dark days of the Trials. Time is of the essence.

               Traveling to the village, you could not feel more unwelcome by the people there, making the plight of the young woman all the more persuasive. Allowed only a brief moment in her confidence, she avows her complete innocence to you before she's dragged away to a private house for temporary imprisonment. Nobody you can approach will acknowledge either the nature nor even the question of her intended fate.

               Many, however, will speak of her crimes, and urge you investigate them yourself before presuming anything. The libidinous characterization of the girl seems unfair, but the uniform agreement from numerous and diverse leaders of the community cannot be ignored.

Established by the children of Cain, the systems of the Indian mantriks have been chiefly concerned with mass population control, warping the lives of billions in pursuit of everlasting sorcerous dominion.

               From the black-eye ranks of a chattel people will rise great wars, driven by the scourge of their ancient masters, and then shall Rome and the nations of the Dark Continent clash while demons unmask and behold their great work.

               Steeped in Gnostic imagery, the rare volume makes a troubling companion to the annuls of Indian history, suggesting a steady path of invasion across the world, beginning in the darkest slave pits of India and plotted by the taloned hands of immortals  serving a forgotten Demiurge of immeasurable influence and unintelligible desire.
